Crewmate is a Discord bot for helping you play Among Us. Made using TypeScript, [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando).

This bot is still a work in progress; I am actively making new features, and if you'd like to suggest something for me to add, please [DM me on Discord](https://discord.com/users/243472272264921088 "Open daniel11420's Discord profile").

### Disclaimer: Some commands may not look correct if the bot does not have the *Use External Emojis* permission. The bot will not work at all without *Embed Links*, as all messages use embeds.

# Contributing
As I said before, you can suggest features in my [Direct Messages](https://discord.com/users/243472272264921088 "Open daniel11420's Discord profile"). 

If you find a bug, make a GitHub issue. **Do not make GitHub issues for suggestions. DM me them and if I decide it's a good idea, I'll make the issue**.

If you'd like to add something to the bot yourself, feel free to make a pull request. If I add something major from a pull request, I'll make sure to credit you in `c help`.
